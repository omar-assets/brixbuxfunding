I want you to scan my entire codebase for the landing page of my funding company website. The current design feels too tech-forward and SaaS-like. I need a plan to transform the UI/UX into a more professional, finance-focused, high-capital funding firm aesthetic, while keeping my current content structure and existing brand colors.

---

# Goal

Transform the website’s look and feel to match a high-end private equity or institutional finance brand — professional, authoritative, sophisticated — instead of a startup SaaS style.

---

# Keep the following as-is

- All content sections, text copy, and layout structure (hero, USPs, case studies, process, final CTA, FAQ).
- Existing brand colors: #5A00E0 (accent), #6B65FF (background), #FFFFFF (text), #9F85FF (buttons), #5A00E0 (links).

---

# Change & Recommendations

## Typography

- Identify current fonts and suggest replacing them with more professional finance-oriented fonts.
- Suggested font families: "Neue Haas Grotesk", "Helvetica Neue", "Inter", or a serif/sans-serif pair (e.g., "Playfair Display" for headings and "Inter" for body).
- Adjust font weights and hierarchy for a strong, confident, elegant look.

## Buttons & CTAs

- Update buttons to have crisper edges or minimal rounding (e.g., 4px).
- Remove neon or heavy glow effects, instead use subtle border accents or soft shadows.
- Improve hover states to be clean (e.g., subtle darkening or thin border highlight rather than bright glow).

## Layout & Spacing

- Increase whitespace between sections and around elements to create a sense of premium minimalism.
- Ensure clear, structured grid layouts with balanced alignment.
- Remove large or flashy animated backgrounds and replace with understated solid or slightly textured backgrounds.

## Iconography

- Replace or adjust icons to use thin line icons or minimal flat icons, consistent in style and stroke weight.
- Remove playful or rounded icon shapes.

## Backgrounds & Visuals

- Remove or minimize animated geometric or futuristic patterns.
- Recommend adding muted finance-themed images (e.g., cityscapes, professional business imagery) in a subtle, blended style.
- Use abstract patterns only as very light overlays if necessary for depth.

## Micro-interactions

- Review and simplify animations: keep fade-ins and gentle slides only.
- Remove exaggerated bouncy or overscaled interactions.
- Add subtle, classy hover effects on links and buttons.

# Output I need from you

Create a **detailed step-by-step implementation plan** with code pointers and file-specific instructions. Specify:

- Which components or files to edit (e.g., HeroSection.jsx, Button.tsx, global.css).
- Which CSS/JS classes to adjust or replace.
- Font import and setup instructions.
- Any suggested code snippets or sample refactors.

# Deliverable

Produce a complete, ready-to-copy implementation plan I can paste into my Replit Coding Agent so it can automatically perform the changes seamlessly and accurately across the entire codebase.

---

# Reminder

Keep the current content structure and brand colors exactly as they are. Focus only on transforming the design language and visual system to feel more professional and finance-focused.
